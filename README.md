## üöÄ Features

- Processes raw scan logs from Nmap and Nikto  
- Extracts basic features like line length and security-related keywords  
- Uses Isolation Forest (unsupervised ML) to detect anomalies  
- Labels each log entry as **Normal** or **Anomaly**  
- Saves results to a file for easy review
